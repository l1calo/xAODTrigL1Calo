	* Set the "Id Revision Date" keywords on all the source files.
	* Used CMMCPHits as an example of how all the other classes
	  should be updated. Demonstrating how documentation should be
	  provided, and how the macros from xAODCore should be used.
	  This included defining all the ElementLink/DataLink dictionaries
	  as well.
	* Added standalone compilation capabilities to the package.
	  (hscript.yml)
	* Not tagging, this is just supposed to be an example for further
	  improvements.
